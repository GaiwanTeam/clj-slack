;; We have an EventSource protocol that allows you to register
;; listeners, which then receive raw slack events. Currently there is
;; one implementation, provided by the slack socket API.

#_(defprotocol EventSource
    (add-listener [this watch-key listener]
      "Register a listener (single-arity function) which will receive raw slack events.
    `watch-key` functions as with [[add-watch]]: passing the same value again
    will replace the previous listener for that key")
    (remove-listener [this watch-key]
      "Remove a previously added listener"))

;; The plan is to make a second implementation which takes a
;; `json-lines` file, and (re-)emits the events in that file. This is
;; mainly meant for development, to have a way to feed fake/fixture
;; data into another component to see how it behaves.
